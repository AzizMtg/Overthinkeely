## What is Anxiety Court?

![ezgif-179f1f05ae2619](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3c5e004-64d8-4904-9197-5ed617d73001)

A simple AI system that helps you deal with anxiety by putting your worries through a courtroom trial. Three AI agents work together:

- **Prosecutor**: Takes your worry and argues for the worst-case scenarios
- **Defense Attorney**: Argues why your worry might not be as bad as you think  
- **Judge**: Makes the final decision and gives you advice

## How It Works

```
Your worry ‚Üí Prosecutor argues worst-case ‚Üí Attorney defends you ‚Üí Judge decides ‚Üí You get help
```

The agents talk to each other and share information to give you better support.

## Current Features

- Three specialized AI agents that collaborate
- Works with free local AI (Ollama)
- Agents can challenge each other's conclusions
- Web interface for easy use
- Stores conversation history


### üéì Inspirations

This project is rooted in real traditions of philosophy and therapy:

- **Socratic Dialogue** ‚Äì testing ideas by letting opposing arguments clash until balance emerges  
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** ‚Äì challenging anxious, extreme thoughts with evidence and rational counterpoints  
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** ‚Äì finding a middle path between emotional extremes  
- **Narrative Therapy** ‚Äì treating problems as something external that can be ‚Äúput on trial‚Äù  

In short: **Anxiety Court** turns timeless methods of reflection into a playful, interactive format.

### ‚öñÔ∏è A Note to Law Students

Yes, we know‚Ä¶ real courts don‚Äôt actually work like this!  
This project is heavily inspired by *Ace Attorney* and courtroom drama in games, not legal accuracy. Think of it as a **theatrical metaphor** for inner dialogue rather than a simulation of real legal systems. If you‚Äôre a law student, forgive the liberties taken, the point is mental health support, not procedural accuracy :p 



## Future Features

### Interactive Court
- Choose which evidence to focus on
- Add your own evidence to the case
- Appeal decisions if you disagree

### Smarter Memory
- Remembers patterns in your worries
- Learns what advice works best for you
- Tracks your progress over time

### Better Tools
- Research psychological techniques
- Connect to breathing exercises
- Integration with calendar for context

### Personality Options
- Detective could act like Sherlock Holmes
- Attorney could be like Phoenix Wright
- Customize how formal or casual they are
